        <h3>Welcome to the Delicious World of Nigerian Cuisine!</h3>
        <p>In this simple yet exquisite dish, five main ingredients are used to make this classic Nigerian stew. These ingredients are:
            <ul>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Red bell peppers</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Onions, and</li>
                <li>Meat of choice</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>However, the caveat for this luxurious dish lies in its cook time and complex steps. First, a broth is made from the meat, then the vegetables are blended and reduced, and finally everything comes together with a good <em>fry</em>!</p>
        <p>But not to worry &mdash; I have practiced this stew, my favorite Nigerian cuisine, over several years and will now give you my take on this classic!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Before, I listed the main ingredients of this stew, and you very well can make something delicious using the following methods and no extra ingredients (besides seasoning!). But this is my preference of how Nigerian Red Stew should be made. Feel free to experiment and research to find what you like. There are plenty of versions out there!</p>
        <p>Now onto the recipe. Here are the ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>16 Roma tomatoes</li>
                <li>8 Red bell peppers</li>
                <li>1 Bulb of garlic</li>
                <li>3 Onions</li>
                <li>6 Habanero peppers</li>
                <li>3 lbs of beef</li>
                <li>Beef bouillon</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Curry powder</li>
                <li>Thyme</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
