        <h3>Welcome to the Delicious World of Nigerian Cuisine!</h3>
        <p>In this simple yet exquisite dish, five main ingredients are used to make this classic Nigerian stew. These ingredients are:
            <ul>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Red bell peppers</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Onions, and</li>
                <li>Meat of choice</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>However, the caveat for this luxurious dish lies in its cook time and complex steps. First, a broth is made from the meat, then the vegetables are blended and reduced, and finally everything comes together with a good <em>fry</em>!</p>
        <p>But not to worry &mdash; I have practiced this stew, my favorite Nigerian cuisine, over several years and will now give you my take on this classic!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Before, I listed the main ingredients of this stew, and you very well can make something delicious using the following methods and no extra ingredients (besides seasoning!). But this is my preference of how Nigerian Red Stew should be made. Feel free to experiment and research to find what you like. There are plenty of versions out there!</p>
        <p>Now onto the recipe. Here are the ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>16 Roma tomatoes</li>
                <li>8 Red bell peppers</li>
                <li>1 Bulb of garlic</li>
                <li>3 Onions</li>
                <li>6 Habanero peppers</li>
                <li>3 lbs of beef</li>
                <li>Beef bouillon</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Curry powder</li>
                <li>Thyme</li>
                <li>1 bottle of vegetable oil</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>Preparing the beef:
            <ol>
                <li>Add 1 chopped onion, 2 chopped habanero peppers, beef bouillon, salt, curry powder, thyme, and beef to a pot.</li>
                <li>Cover pot and set heat to high medium. Let meat cook for 15 minutes to release its juices.</li>
                <li>After, fill pot with water until meat is almost completely covered and continue to cook meat until desired texture.</li>
                <li>Once meat is done, remove meat from broth and place it in a bowl. Preheat oven to 450&deg;F. Set broth aside.</li>
                <li>Add salt and enough vegetable oil to the bowl to coat the meat. Stir the meat.</li>
                <li>Place oiled meat onto a baking tray with parchment paper and place it in the oven. Cook meat until browned.</li>
                <li>Once browned, set meat aside to be used for later.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Preparing the pepper sauce:
            <ol>
                <li>While the meat is cooking, chop tomatoes, bell peppers, garlic, and remaining habanero and onions (set aside &frac12; an onion).</li>
                <li>Blend all vegetables until desired consistency.</li>
                <li>Transfer sauce to a pot. Set heat to medium high.</li>
                <li>Reduce sauce until nearly all liquid is gone.</li>
                <li>Set sauce aside.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Frying the sauce and beef:
            <ol>
                <li>Add remaining vegetable oil to a pot. Heat oil on low medium heat.</li>
                <li>Once oil is heated, add the chopped &frac12; an onion to the pot and fry for 2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add sauce, beef bouillon, salt, curry powder, thyme, and broth to the oil. Quickly mix them together, then cover pot partially to allow proper frying.</li>
                <li>Stir occassionly to prevent the sauce from burning. Sauce is done once oil settles on top of it.</li>
                <li>Now add the meat to the pot and fry for 10 minutes so the meat can absorb the red stew.</li>
                <li>Enjoy with parboiled rice or any other white rice.</li>
            </ol>
