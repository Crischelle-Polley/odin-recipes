        <h3>Welcome to the Delicious World of Nigerian Cuisine!</h3>
        <p>In this simple yet exquisite dish, five main ingredients are used to make this classic Nigerian stew. These ingredients are:
            <ul>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Red bell peppers</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Onions, and</li>
                <li>Meat of choice</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>However, the caveat for this luxurious dish lies in its cook time and complex steps. First, a broth is made from the meat, then the vegetables are blended and reduced, and finally everything comes together with a good <em>fry</em>!</p>
        <p>But not to worry &mdash; I have practiced this stew, my favorite Nigerian cuisine, over several years and will now give you my take on this classic!</p>
